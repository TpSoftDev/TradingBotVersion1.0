## Technical Skills and Technologies
### MetaTrader 5 API
The MT5 API is a crucial component for interacting with the trading platform. It allows for the retrieval of historical data, account information, and real-time trading operations. Mastery of this API is essential for developing robust and efficient trading applications.

### Data Handling and Processing
The bot makes extensive use of the `datetime` module for date manipulation and `pandas` for data handling. `pandas` is particularly powerful for managing large datasets, performing operations like resampling, and ensuring data integrity. These skills are critical for any data-driven application.

### Data Visualization
Plotly is used for data visualization, creating dynamic and interactive charts that provide clear insights into the trading data. Plotlyâ€™s integration with `pandas` allows for seamless data plotting, highlighting proficiency in modern visualization techniques.

### Tabular Data Presentation
The `tabulate` library is utilized for presenting data in a clean and structured manner. This is particularly useful for displaying account information and historical rates in a readable format. Effective data presentation is essential for making informed trading decisions.

### Software Development Best Practices
The code demonstrates several best practices, including:
- Modular design: Functions are clearly defined and separated by functionality, making the codebase easy to maintain and extend.
- Error handling: Ensures robustness by checking data validity and handling exceptions.
- Documentation: Provides clear and concise docstrings, aiding in understanding and maintaining the code.
